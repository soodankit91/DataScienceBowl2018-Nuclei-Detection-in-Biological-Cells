# DataScienceBowl2018-Nuclei-Detection-in-Biological-Cells

This is a solution to Kaggle's Data Science Bowl 2018, where the task was to identify Nuclei in biological cells images

Problem Description: Given several segmented nuclei images of biological cells and multiple images of masks per cell image, depicting the cellâ€™s nuclei, the task is to train a model which would detect nuclei in unseen images of cells and report them as run length encoded pixels. 

Approach: Using a state of the art neural network for biological images, UNET for identification of nuclei in the test data.
